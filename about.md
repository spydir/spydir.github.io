With a rich background in entrepreneurship and international exposure, Lee brings a unique perspective to his work in cyber security.

Throughout his career, Lee has demonstrated a strong track record in DFIR, working with prestigious organizations such as Trustwave SpiderLabs and Palantir. At Trustwave, Lee supported and trained the US Secret Service in cyber investigations, honing his skills in high-stakes, high-pressure environments. At Palantir, he was the first member of the Forward Deployed Security Engineering team and provided incident response services to Fortune 50 companies, managing complex and large-scale cyber security incidents.

Building from his international exposure and experience with large businesses, Lee Co-Founded and was the CTO of Horangi Cyber Security, the first cyber security startup in Singapore.

He also continues to mentor up-and-coming entrepreneurs from his local college and founders of other start-ups he has met throughout his travels.

### Hobbies and Stuff

When it comes to stuff outside the 9 to 5, Lee's got a whole universe of passions to keep him busy. He's a "Hacker", not like the cloak-and-dagger guys you see on TV, but in the real deal way, where it's all about whether you can hack it or not. He's the Jack-of-all-trades, master of some, who loves jerry-rigging solutions for whatever life throws at him. He's got his hands in everything from traditional crafts like metalwork, woodwork, and leatherwork to the high-tech wizardry of electronics, CNC machines, 3D printers, and every gizmo under the sun.

So, what does he do with this wild mix of skills? Everything, really! He's fixing up his jeep, crafting one-of-a-kind widgets for his D&D gang, working with AI to weave epic stories for Warhammer 40k campaigns, hand-making tools for the garden, designing baby toys, and tackling all sorts of off-the-wall, mind-bending projects. He's all about diving headfirst into tricky, unique problems (and trust me, he's no stranger to the school of hard knocks). But hey, that's how you learn, right?
