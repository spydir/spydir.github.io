Hey folks, Lee here, and today we're diving headfirst into a topic that I get asked about a lot – breaking into the wild, wild west of the information security field. It's not a walk in the park, but with some elbow grease, curiosity, and a dash of daring, you can get way ahead of the other candidates. Let's dive in.

First things first, let's chat about certifications. Sure, they might seem about as fun as a trip to the dentist, but trust me, they're _vital_ as you get started in this line of work. It's like going on a quest where each certification is a badge of honor, showing the world (and more importantly, employers) that you're investing in yourself and are interested in growing your skills. 

For me, when I see someone training to break into the field with a set of certifications, it's less about demonstrating skills and more about demonstrating mindset - and mindset is _powerful_. Having a CISSP does not make you a good CISO and having an OSCP does not make you a good pentester. However, having a few certs that you earn yourself (rather than having a company is willing to pay for them) speaks volumes about your aptitude and attitude. 

But let me break it to you straight: having CompTIA certifications alone is like bringing a butter knife to a sword fight. Don't get me wrong, CompTIA certs are cool and all, but they're just not gonna cut it by themselves. Remember, It's a crowded field out there, and you need to bring your A-game because the other candidates are. 

So consider grabbing more advanced certifications like: 
- [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/) from TCM Security 
- [eJPT](https://my.ine.com/certifications) from INE 
- [CPTS](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications) from Hack The Box

It's like leveling up in a video game – the more you have, the stronger you get. When I interview people, I really want to hear the story around why they chose those certs and what the hardest thing was about earning them. 

_Also, avoid the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) - I’ll just leave that one hanging right there awkwardly and with no further explanation._ 
(imagine a cutscene with crickets, someone awkwardly looking off into the distance, and the sound of a slurping straw)

Next on the docket, let's talk about meet-ups and conferences. Now, I get it. Networking can feel like pulling teeth too. All those business cards, LinkedIn connections, and elevator pitches can be enough to make your head spin. But here's the thing: information security is a community. 

We're all in this fight together, and the more connections you make, the more opportunities you'll have. Plus, they're a gold mine for learning. You'll hear about the latest threats, the coolest technologies, and the craziest stories. Find the conferences that are closest, cheapest, and have the most people you know. 

Personally, I like: 

- [Thotcon](https://www.thotcon.org/)  - Shoutout to my spiderlabs homies!
- [CackalackyCon](https://cackalackycon.org/) - This is my hometown conference
- [Techno-Security](https://www.technosecurity.us/) - This one is close too, it's a bit too commercial but I'm a DFIR guy and a lot of people I know attend. 
- [shmoocon](https://www.shmoocon.org/) - This is always my "Next year" conference, I've not actually attended before! I'm totally fomo on this one :-()
- [Defcon](https://www.defcon.org) - This is where it all started, but it has gotten really big these days so I tend just help with one of the contests

Ask your friends what they are attending or checkout this link and find something that works for you: https://infosec-conferences.com/


One you go to some conferences, slap those experiences on your resume and let them know that you're not just sitting on the sidelines. You're in the game, baby.

Finally, we're gonna touch on something near and dear to my hacker heart: home labsess (said with LoTR Golem Voice). This is where you roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. Think of it as your personal playground for testing out all the crazy, cool tech you've been reading about. 

Want to experiment with a Synology Network Attached Storage (NAS) system? Go for it. Want to set up a Pi-hole to block ads network-wide? More power to you. Keen on running penetration testing VMs to hone your skills and level up your CTF ranking with TryHackMe or Hack The Box? You've got my full support. 

The sky's the limit, and the best part is that you're learning by doing. Plus, it shows potential employers that you've got the drive and initiative to go beyond the call of duty. It's like having your cake and eating it too, but the cake is knowledge, and it's delicious.

So there you have it, folks. Breaking into the information security field might seem daunting, but with the right mindset, resources, and a whole lot of perseverance, you'll be on your way to becoming a full-fledged infosec operator. 

Remember, it's not just about the certifications or the connections or the home lab. It's about the _passion_, the _curiosity_, and the _relentless drive_ to make the digital world a safer place. So get out there, make your mark, and most importantly, have fun! 

Until next time, happy hacking!
